  Simple Analisis

This is a Python project that completed a test task:
initial data:

Get dataset (data).

Generate count data using a random number generator. Numbers are integers, range: from -10000 to 10000; number of numbers â€“ 1000. Create a Series object.

Calculate standard numerical characteristics for a series data set

determine minimum results
number of determination of repeating results
determine the highest value
determine the reliability of numbers
determine the standard deviation
The resulting data is displayed in the console with explanations. You can use all standard Python functions to complete this task.

Visualize data using standard libraries according to specified criteria.

build a line graph
build a histogram (rectangular), rounding the values of the data set to hundreds. Rounding is adjusted according to a mathematical rule.
Create a Dataframe from a series of data and add the following columns to this data

column, sequentially sorted values of the original series by age
column, sequentially sorted values of the original series in descending order
Visualize data obtained as a result of intermediate analysis (calculations)

build two line graphs on one site: sorted results by age and descending. write readme.md file for solution of this code for github
